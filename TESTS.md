Test Instructions
=================


QRL Wallet will use a combination of Cucumber and Chimp for test driven development. Chimp integrates well with Meteor for automated testing.

To run local tests, use the following command after starting Meteor.


`chimp --ddp=http://localhost:3000 --watch --path=tests`
