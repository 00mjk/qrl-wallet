#### Build Web Assembly XMSS WASM / JS Files

XMSS Libraries are generated using Emscripten and loaded client side with WebAssembly. 

Two files are generated by the [qrllib](https://github.com/theQRL/qrllib) `build_webassembly.sh` script.

- `web-libjsqrl.js`
- `web-libjsqrl.wasm`

`web-libjsqrl.js` is stored in `imports/startup/client/` and `web-libjsqrl.wasm` is stored in `public/` of this repo.


> _There is a quirk with how Meteor scopes variables and loads the 'Module' variable from `web-libjsqrl.js`. After building the file in [qrllib](https://github.com/theQRL/qrllib), `QRLLIB=Module;` must be appended to the end of the `web-libjsqrl.js` file, which allows all exported functions to be accessed inside Meteor through the QRLLIB object._

This functionality will at a later date be ported to an npm package.
